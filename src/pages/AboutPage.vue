        <h1 style="color: whitesmoke; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 10px;">About me</h1>
        <h3 style="color: whitesmoke;">Naturally curious and disciplined software developer who strives in high-pressure and challenging environment. I love tackling problems using Java and my knowledge of different
            technologies, tools, and algorithms to build efficient and scalable applications.

        <h1 style="color: whitesmoke; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 10px;">Background</h1>
        <h3 style="color: whitesmoke;">I originally came from Hanoi, Vietnam  <span class="fi fi-vn"></span> , but I went to Toronto, Canada <span class="fi fi-ca"></span>  when I was 15 for high school, and I later went to Eindhoven,
            the Netherlands <span class="fi fi-nl"></span> to pursue a Bachelor degree in Computer Science at Eindhoven University, which I obtained in 2024. 
        </h3><br>
        <h3 style="color: whitesmoke;">I picked up Java in my junior year of high school as I aspired to be a core developer for my high school robotics team, and I have been
            restlessly learning ever since. I am a strong believer that knowledge and experience is not something to be taken for granted, like many things in life, so I strive to keep myself busy and educated
            through personal projects, internships and part time jobs to strengthen my foothold in the software development industry.

        <h1 style="color: whitesmoke; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 10px;">Skills and Interests</h1>

        <h3 style="color: whitesmoke;">I have the most experience with <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Java</span>, but I also have working knowledge of <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #5C8BC6;">Python, and C++</span>. 
            I also have experience with building full-stack web applications using the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #42B882;">MEVN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Vue, NodeJS)</span> tech-stack, how to write parallel 
            computing programs using the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #78B800;">NVIDIA CUDA C++ framework</span>, and how to build a data pipeline with a visualization dashboard using 
            <span style="color: #00C1CD; font-weight: bold;">Pyspark, Airflow and Python</span>. Some usage of the technology I mentioned can be found in my list of <a href="/projects">personal projects</a>,
             and others can be found in past experiences in my <a href="">Curriculum Vitae</a>.
